\begin{abstract}
  We propose an agent based model for approximating the competitive
  equilibrium for exchange economies. Our model employs simple agents
  engaged in bilateral trade in a network. Highly parallel agent algorithms and
  minimal graph operations allow for agents to trade to equilibrium over many
  different network topologies. We employ the wealth effect alone to guide our
  search in a large space of possible topologies.

\section{Endowments}
Consider \(m\) agents trading in an exchange economy with \(n\) goods.
Let agent \(j\) have endowment \((x_1^j, x_i^j, \dots, x_n^j)\)
where \(i\in\left{1,\dots,n\right}\)
and \(j\in\left{1,\dots,m\right}\)
and let the agents' endowments satisfy the following constraints:
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{j=1}^m x_i^j= m \quad\forall i\in\left{1,\dots,n\right}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^j = 1 \quad\forall j\in\left{1,\dots,m\right}
\end{equation}
That is, the sum of each good \(i\) in the economy is equal to m
Additionally, agents must have non negative endowments of each good.
